    title: "Coral Genomics"
    excerpt: "Reef-building corals provide the structural basis for one of Earth’s most spectacular and diverse—but increasingly threatened—ecosystems. Modern Indo-Pacific reefs are dominated by species of the staghorn coral genus _Acropora_ (Anthozoa: Acroporidae), one of the most diverse genera with close to 150 species, but the evolutionary and ecological factors associated with their diversification are unclear. Hence, I am interested in examining GTD and duplication in the diversification of _Acropora_. <br><br>

    Previous study showed that strong evidence for GTD caused by introgression in _Acropora_ as well as that the introgressed genes are evolving faster than the rest of genes. These results are consistent with a role for GTD in spreading adaptive genetic variations. (Mao et al., 2018, Current Biology; Mao et al., 2020, Molecular Ecology Resources). In addition, an ancient genome duplication event is shared by _Acropora_. RNA-seq analysis showed that the different functional clusters of duplicated genes are related to the divergence of gene expression patterns during development. The specific duplicated toxin genes in _Acropora_ potentially contribute to their adaptation (Mao et al., 2019, iScience; Mao, 2019, PeerJ). <br><br>

    Therefore, _Acropora_ is a great system to investigate the interactions between SV/GTD and selection. I aim to combine long-read sequencing and experimental approaches to illustrate what the roles of SV & GTD paly in the evolution of _Acropora_."

    title: "Primate Genomics"
    excerpt: "The divergence of living great apes provides one of few examples of recent hominid speciation. Characterizing hominid evolution is essential to understanding the origins of humans and disease. Long-read great ape genomes have been published, but the SV and GTD maps of hominid are less known. Previous study found that at least 36.5% of the human genome is under GTD. Importantly, GTD isn't randomly distributed in the human genome, the genes located in the clustered GTD regions show accelerated amino acid replacement. These results suggest that relaxed/positive selection drives GTD. Further, genomic diversity of great apes showed that both long-term balancing selection and background selection/purifying selection also contribute to the genomic architecture of GTD (Mao et al., 2021, Nature). <br><br>

    Primate genomics is one of the most well-studied systems and is critically important for brain evolution studies and general evolutionary theory. Hence, with the advance of long-read sequencing and graph-based alignment method (Logsdon et al., 2020, Nature Reviews Genetics), I aim to investigate whether SV and GTD result in functional difference within primates. Especially, I’d like to illustrate how brain evolve from monkeys to apes with genomics and experimental approaches."

A major goal of evolutionary biology is to understand how evolutionary processes lead to speciation and diversification. Structural variation is a significant evolutionary force on adaptive evolution (for example, larger brain in human). Gene tree discordance (GTD) is mainly caused by neutral evolution (e.g., incomplete lineage sorting (ILS)) or introgression. GTD usually leads to diversity and adaptation in organism groups (for example, ABO blood types in humans and mimicry in butterflies). However, we lack a comprehensive understanding of SV in species/population diversity because of difficulties in resolving SV using standard short-read sequencing approaches. Additionally, we are currently unable to build a comprehensive genomic map of GTD that could enable comparative genomics due to a lack of high-quality genome assemblies. <br><br>

Therefore, my research interests are about to use long-read sequencing technologies to build high-quality genome assemblies of two diverse groups (reef-building corals and primates) in order to 1) uncover the genetic architecture of SV and GTD in each group, and 2) determine how SV and GTD, driven by natural selection, lead to adaptation, speciation, and diversification in these species.
